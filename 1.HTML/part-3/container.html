        HTML 요소는 묶는 컨테이너 요소들
        - 아무런 의미 없는(Smeantic)는 가지지 않는다.
        - 그러하므로 이 요소들은 적절한 시멘틱 요소가 없을 때 사용해야 한다.

            <h2>My use of language and my cats</h2>
            <p>My cat’s behavior hasn’t changed much since her absence, except
               that she plays her new physique to the neighbors regularly, in an

          <p>My other cat, colored black and white, is a sweetie. He followed  
             us to the pool today, walking down the pavement with us. Yesterday
             he apparently visited our neighbours. I wonder if he recognizes that
            their flat is a mirror image of ours.</p>
          <p>Hm, I just noticed that in the last paragraph I used British
          English. But I’m supposed to write in American English. So I
          shouldn’t say "pavement" or "flat" or "color"...</p>

            <p>I should say "sidewalk" and "apartment" and "color"!</p>
